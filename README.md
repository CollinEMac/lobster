Welcome to the Lobster programming language!
============================================


Lobster is a statically typed programming language with a Python-esque
syntax that combines the advantages of an expressive type system and
compile-time memory management with a very lightweight, friendly and
terse syntax, by doing most of the heavy lifting for you.

The homepage has more on [the "why" of Lobster](http://strlen.com/lobster/).

Read the full
[documentation](http://aardappel.github.io/lobster/README_FIRST.html)
on how to use it, or skip straight to the
[getting started](http://aardappel.github.io/lobster/getting_started.html) guide.
